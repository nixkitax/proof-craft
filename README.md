# ProofCraft üõ†Ô∏è

**A collection of implementations and experiments for verifiable similarity search queries on vector databases, Merkle Trees, and related data structures.**

---

## Overview

ProofCraft is a modular and experimental project designed to explore and implement techniques for ensuring the verifiability and transparency of similarity search queries on vector databases. This repository includes implementations of cryptographic data structures (like Merkle Trees), optimized vector indexing methods, and proof-of-concept systems for verifiable data retrieval.
